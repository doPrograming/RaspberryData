# RaspberryData
Simple app for data transfer from pi to pc or any other device

The application is build for user who want a remote control of RaspberryPi.
We will have some type of robot, and it will be possible to move it by remote (web page, android...)
For now it has a sensor for humanity, temperature, led lights and it can measure the distance from objects.
